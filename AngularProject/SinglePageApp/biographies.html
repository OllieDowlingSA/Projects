Kurt Cobain was an American musician who was best known as the lead singer, 
guitarist, and primary songwriter of the rock band Nirvana.

After signing with major label DGC Records, the band found breakthrough success 
with "Smells Like Teen Spirit" from its second album Nevermind (1991). Following 
the success of Nevermind, Nirvana was labeled "the flagship band" of Generation X, 
and Cobain hailed as "the spokesman of a generation".Cobain, however, was often 
uncomfortable and frustrated, believing his message and artistic vision to have been
misinterpreted by the public, with his personal issues often subject to media attention.<strong>(wikipedia.org)</strong>

<h3>Death and Courtney Love.</h3>

<p>
During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with heroin addiction, illness and depression. 
He also had difficulty coping with his fame and public image, and the professional and lifelong personal 
pressures surrounding himself and his wife, musician Courtney Love. On April 8, 1994, 
Cobain was found dead at his home in Seattle, the victim of what was officially ruled a suicide 
by a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head. 
</p>

<p>
The circumstances of his death at age 27 have become a topic of public fascination and debate. Since their debut, 
Nirvana, with Cobain as a songwriter, has sold over 25 million albums in the US, and over 75 million worldwide. 
Together with Nirvana bandmates Novoselic and Dave Grohl, Cobain was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll 
Hall of Fame in 2014, in their first year of eligibility.<strong>(wikipedia.org)</strong>
