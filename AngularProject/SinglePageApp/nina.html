<h3>Biography.</h3>

<p>
Nina Simone(born Eunice Kathleen Waymon; February 21, 
1933 – April 21, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, 
arranger, and civil rights activist. She worked in a broad range of musical 
styles including classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop.
The sixth child of a preacher's family in North Carolina, Simone aspired to 
be a concert pianist. Her musical path changed direction after she was denied 
a scholarship to the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, 
despite a well-received audition.<strong>(wikipedia.org)</strong>

Simone said she later found out from an insider at Curtis that she was denied entry because she was black.
So as to fund her continuing musical education and become a classical pianist, she began playing in a 
small club in Philadelphia where she was also required to sing. She was approached for a recording by 
Bethlehem Records, and her rendering of "I Loves You, Porgy" was a hit in the United States in 1958. 
Over the length of her career Simone recorded more than 40 albums, mostly between 1958, when she made her 
debut with Little Girl Blue, and 1974.<strong>(wikipedia.org)</strong>

<h3>Civil Rights Era.</h3>

<p>
In 1964, she changed record distributors, from the American Colpix to the Dutch Philips, 
which also meant a change in the contents of her recordings. Simone had always included 
songs in her repertoire that drew upon her African-American origins (such as "Brown Baby" 
and "Zungo" on Nina at the Village Gate in 1962). On her debut album for Philips, Nina Simone 
in Concert (live recording, 1964), however, Simone for the first time openly addressed the racial 
inequality that was prevalent in the United States with the song "Mississippi Goddam", her response 
to the murder of Medgar Evers and the bombing of a church in Birmingham, Alabama that killed four black children.<strong>(wikipedia.org)</strong>
</p>

<p>
The song was released as a single, and it was boycotted in certain southern states. 
Specifically, promotional copies were smashed by a Carolina radio station and returned to 
Simone's record label. "Old Jim Crow", on the same album, addressed the Jim Crow laws.
