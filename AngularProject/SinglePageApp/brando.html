famous for his Academy Award-winning performances as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront (1954) and 
Vito Corleone in The Godfather (1972), as well as influential performances in A Streetcar Named Desire 
(1951), Viva Zapata! (1952), Julius Caesar (1953), The Wild One (1953), Reflections in a Golden Eye 
(1967), Last Tango in Paris (1972) and Apocalypse Now (1979). Brando was also an activist, supporting

He initially gained acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for reprising the role of Stanley Kowalski 
in the 1951 film adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play A Streetcar Named Desire, which made him a Broadway 
star during its 1947–49 stage run. He received further acclaim for his performance as Terry Malloy in On 
the Waterfront (1954), and for his iconic portrayal of the rebel motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler 
in The Wild One (1953), considered to be one of the most famous images in pop culture.<strong>(wikipedia.org)</strong>

<h3>Rise to Fame.</h3>

<p>
Brando brought his performance as Stanley Kowalski to the screen in Kazan's adaptation of A Streetcar 
Named Desire (1951). The role remains one of his most iconic and imitated. The critical reception of 
Brando's performance was so overwhelmingly positive that Brando quickly became the main male sex symbol 
in Hollywood.<strong>(wikipedia.org)</strong>
</p>

<p>
Brando's animal magnetism and raw power, best evident in the scene where he stands on the street and yells 
"Stella!", was so convincing to audiences that years later Brando stated, "Even today I meet people who think 
of me automatically as a tough, insensitive, coarse guy named Stanley Kowalski. They can't help it, but, it is 
troubling." The role earned Brando his first Academy Award nomination in the Best Actor category.
