Robert De Niro; born August 17, 1943 is an American actor and 
producer who has starred in over 90 films. His first major film roles were 
in the sports drama Bang the Drum Slowly (1973) and Martin Scorsese's crime 
film Mean Streets (1973). In 1974, after being turned down for the role of Sonny
Corleone in the crime film The Godfather (1972), he was cast as the young Vito 
Corleone in The Godfather Part II (1974), a role for which he won the Academy 
Award for Best Supporting Actor.<strong>(wikipedia.org)</strong>

De Niro's longtime collaboration with Scorsese later earned him an Academy Award 
for Best Actor for his portrayal of Jake LaMotta in the 1980 film Raging Bull. 
He also earned nominations for the psychological thrillers Taxi Driver (1976) 
and Cape Fear (1991), both directed by Scorsese. De Niro received additional 
Academy Award nominations for Michael Cimino's Vietnam war drama The Deer Hunter (1978), 
Penny Marshall's drama Awakenings (1990), and David O. Russell's romantic comedy-drama 
Silver Linings Playbook (2012).<strong>(wikipedia.org)</strong>

<h3>Acting and filmmaking.</h3>

<p>
De Niro's first film role came at the age of 20, when he appeared in Brian De Palma's 1963 film 
The Wedding Party, but the film was not released until 1969. He then appeared in Roger Corman's 
film Bloody Mama (1970). He gained popular attention with his role as a dying Major League Baseball 
player in Bang the Drum Slowly (1973) and began his collaboration with Martin Scorsese when he played 
the small-time criminal Johnny Boy in Mean Streets (1973).<strong>(wikipedia.org)</strong>
</p>

<p>
De Niro had a pivotal role in the Francis Ford Coppola film The Godfather Part II (1974), playing the 
young Vito Corleone. Coppola had remembered his previous auditions for the roles of Sonny Corleone, 
Michael Corleone, Carlo Rizzi, and Paulie Gatto in The Godfather. His performance earned him his first 
Academy Award, for Best Supporting Actor, although Coppola accepted the award as De Niro was not present 
at the ceremony. De Niro became the first actor to win an Academy Award speaking mainly a foreign language; 
in this case, multiple Sicilian dialects, although he delivered a few lines in English. He and Marlon Brando, 
who played the older Vito Corleone in the first film, are the only actors to have won Oscars for portraying the 
same fictional character. The two came together onscreen for the only time in The Score (2001).
